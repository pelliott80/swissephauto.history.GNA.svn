the swe-standard-data package installes the standard files, i.e. the
.se1 files in /usr/share/libswe/users/ephe
This is all the data a typical Swiss Ephemeris users would want.
This package installs it all rather than burden the user with
thinking about what data he wants. disk space has become cheap.


Low memory users may want a subset of this data.
They can either install the data they want themselves or
send an email to Paul Elliott <pelliott@blackpatchpanel.com>
asking him to package a specific subset.

In addition there are numberless asteroid files at the
astrodienst site. No one would want all of these. If you want
one of these you may either install it yourself or ask
Paul Elliott <pelliott@blackpatchpanel.com> to package a specific
file.

Except, I have added one of the extra astroid files, se00433s.se1 as a
sample.  This file is not particularly important, but it makes one of
the tests listed in the swetest manpage work. It also serves to show
where such files should be stored.  That is, parrellel to their
location on astrodienst. In this case, that is,
/usr/share/libswe/users/ephe/ast0
