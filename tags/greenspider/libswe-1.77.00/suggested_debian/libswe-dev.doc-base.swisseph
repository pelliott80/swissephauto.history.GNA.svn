Title: Swiss Ephemeris General Documentation
Author: Dieter Koch and Alois Treindl
Abstract: Swiss Ephemeris is a function package for the computation of
 planetary positions. It includes the planets, the moon, the lunar
 nodes, the lunar apogees, the main asteroids, Chiron, Pholus, the
 fixed stars and several hypothetical bodies. Hundreds of other
 minor planets are included as well. Ephemeris files all numbered
 asteroids are available for download.
 The precision of the Swiss Ephemeris is very high. It is at least as
 accurate as the Astromical Almanac, the standard planetary and lunar
 tables astronomers refer to. Swiss Ephemeris will, be able
 to keep abreast to the scientific advances in ephemeris computation
 for the coming decades. The expense will be small. In most cases an
 update of the data files will do.
