This is the README file for Swiss Ephemeris library made with
autotools on GNU/LINUX or other autotools friendly environments.
As of today, no changes have been made to the original Swiss Ephemeris
source code.

Format of source version. The current source version is
1.77.00.0001. In this number is the source version of the 
Astrodienst files. That is this version of the Swiss Ephemeris library for
Autotools is based on the file swe_unix_src_1.77.00.tar.gz
from Astrodienst. The 0001 part indicates this is the first version for the
autotools part.


The Swiss Ephemeris also runs under MSDOS, Windows, and other
environments. For that version see: http://www.astro.com/swisseph/

The file COPYING and LICENSE  describe the license for this version
of the program.

the doc subdirectory contains the original documentation which exhaustively
documents the API.

The file INSTALL tells how the library may be installed.

The files should be organized like this:


$(top_builddir)  -----|  main autotools control files including configure.ac
                 |
                 +----|  $(top_builddir)/src -- build autotools files for
                 |                              libraries, executables
                 +----|  $(top_builddir)/doc -- build autotools files for
                 |                              documentation
                 +----|  $(top_builddir)/astrodienst =$(astrodienst)
                 |                              source distribution files from
                 |                              astrodienst 
                 +----|  $(top_builddir)/astrodocsrc =$(astrodocsrc)
                                                Astrodienst source files left out
                                                of astrodienst's distribution.
                                                Resourced by Paul Elliott.
                                                contains note from astrodienst
                                                asserting the LICENSE.

The files refered to by $(astrodienst) and $(astrodocsrc) can be moved
at make time by defining astrodienst and astrodocsrc on the make line:
i.e.
./configure   my_other_parameters
make astrodienst=my_location_for_swe_distribution_files \
astrodocsrc=my_location_for_swe_doc_files
sudo make install


Hopefully the astrodocsrc directory will be come unneccessary at the
next release from astrodienst!

The astrodienst distribution contains pdf and html files that document
the library extensively. These files have been rebuild from their
sources in the for GNU/LINUX versions. Refer to these files for all
documentation.

Astrodienst did not provide GNU/Linux style man pages. My man pages refer
users to astrodienst's other documentation.

Astrodienst has asked me to remove the public interface to pcalc, i.e.
swepcalc.h. 
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/swisseph/message/3129
This will make this version of astrodienst upwards compatible
with the next release from astrodienst which will not included it.
I believe no freesoftware actualy uses this code.
Remove #include "swepcalc.h" from your code if you have it.
This version of the library will not work if you do this include.
You will have to remove it anyway when v 78 comes out because astrodienst is 
making it go away.

Most GNU/linux users will want the Swiss Emphemris basic data, that is
all the .txt files in Astrodienst distribution. Alternatively,
the user can supply his own data in a private directory.

In addition users will want the astrodienst .se1 files.
