This is the README file for Swiss Ephemeris library documentation made
with autotools on GNU/LINUX or other autotools friendly environments.
As of today, no changes have been made to the original Swiss Ephemeris
source code.

This is the Swiss Ephemeris library documentation files from astrodienst.
Pdf and .html files are created from the corresponding doc files.
The man pages are not found here, they are found with the libswe-dev
packages.

Format of source version. The current source version is
1.77.00.0006. In this number is the source version of the Astrodienst
files. That is this version of the Swiss Ephemeris library
documentation for Autotools is based on the file
sweph.zip from Astrodienst. The 0006 part indicates
this is the sixth version for the autotools part.
The folks at astrodienst do not save their distribution files
by version number. This when a new version comes out, the old
version is wiped out on the astrodienst web/ftp site. In order to
maintain an historical record, thie sweph.zip files are also stored
in the Swiss Ephemeris AutoTools download area in version dependent
subdirectories. Thus the file, 
http://download.gna.org/swissephauto/astrodienst/sweph1.78/sweph.zip
will be the 1.78 version of this file. The source files we use are:
swephprg.doc and swisseph.doc.

The Swiss Ephemeris also runs under MSDOS, Windows, and other
environments. For that version see: http://www.astro.com/swisseph/

The file COPYING and LICENSE  describe the license for this version
of the program.

the doc subdirectory contains the original documentation which exhaustively
documents the API.

The file INSTALL tells how the library may be installed.

The files are organized like this:
