April 2011 Paul Elliott ports Swiss Ephemeris to Linux adding
auto*tools infrastructure.

July 2011 Paul Elliott uses vpath to seperate source from astrodienst 
into a seperate directories from the directories containing the 
auto*tools control files.

August 2011 Astrodienst has asked me to remove the public 
interface to pcalc, i.e. swepcalc.h.

This will make this version of astrodienst upwards compatible
with the next release from astrodienst which will not included it.
I believe no freesoftware actualy uses this code.
Remove #include "swepcalc.h" from your code if you have it.
This version of the library will not work if you do this include.
You will have to remove it anyway when v 78 comes out because astrodienst is 
making it go away.

August 2013 remove the massive documentation from astrodienst,
the .pdf and .html files from libswe into their own source
package libswe-doc. These files can be quite tricky to build from
source.
