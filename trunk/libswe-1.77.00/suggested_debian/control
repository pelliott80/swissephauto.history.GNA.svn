Description: C library for The Swiss Ephemeris
 Contains static library, headers, example code and development manpages
 for libswe0.
 The Swiss Ephemeris offers these advantages:
 The Swiss Ephemeris is based upon the latest planetary and lunar
 ephemeris, DE405/406, developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion
 Laboratory. The original integration, DE405, covered the years 3000 BC
 to 3000 AD and required 550 Mb of disk space. DE406 is a compressed
 version of DE405 which requires 200 MB while maintaining a precision
 of better than 1 m for the moon and 25 m for the planets. These data
 have been further compressed with sophisticated compression techniques
 developed by Astrodienst. The ephemeris now requires for the complete
 6000 years only 5 Mb for all planets except the Moon, and 13 Mb for
 the Moon. This compressed ephemeris reproduces the JPL data with 0.001
 arcseconds precision. Astrodienst has extended the timespan of the JPL
 ephemeris by numerical integration, so that Swiss Ephemeris covers the
 years 5400 BC to 5400 AD, a total of 10'800 years. For this extended
 timespan the ephemeris requires 32 Mbytes of ephemeris files.
 All transformation steps from the inertial timeframe of the JPL DE406
 integration to the reference frame for astrological coordinates (true
 equinox of date), all corrections like relativistic aberration,
 deflection of light in the gravity field of the Sun etc. have been
 performed with utmost care and precision so that the target precision
 of 0.001 arcsec is maintained through all transformation steps. Never
 before has such a high precision ephemeris been available to
 astrologers.
 Swiss Ephemeris contains three ephemerides. The user can choose
 whether he/she wants to use the original JPL DE406 data (if available
 at his/her site), the compressed Swiss Ephemeris data (the default) or
 a built in semianalytic theory by Steve Moshier. The Swiss Ephemeris
 package switches automatically to the available best precision
 ephemeris dependent on which installed ephemeris files it finds. Even
 without any stored ephemeris files, using the Moshier model, planetary
 positions with better than 0.1 seconds of arc precision are available
 (3 arcsec for the Moon). 
 In addition to the astronomical planets as contained in the JPL
 integration, Astrodienst has included all other bodies and hypothetical
 factors which are of interest to the astrologer. Astrodienst has used 
 Astrodienst's own  numerical integration program to provide ephemerides 
 for ALL known  asteroids. There are over 55'000 of them and nobody will 
 be able to use them all. Astrodienst distribute these extended asteroid 
 files via Astrodienst's download area; there are also CDROMs available 
 with large  sets of asteroid files. Asteroid reaserachers may be 
 interested in a December  1998 article in the Economist magazine about 
 the naming of  asteroids.
 Speed: The Swiss Ephemeris is precise and fast. On Astrodienst's Linux 
 test machine, a 1000 MHz Pentium III, Astrodienst compute 10'000 complete 
 sets of planetary positions, i.e. 10'000 x 11 planets, in 9 seconds. 
 This is 0.9 milliseconds for the complete set of exact planetary 
 positions
 (consecutive 1 day steps).

Description: C library for the Swiss Ephemeris
 libswe0 allows programs to access the Swiss Ephemeris.
 The SWISS EPHEMERIS is the high precision ephemeris developed 
 by Astrodienst, largely based upon the DE406 ephemeris from NASA's JPL.

Package: swe-basic-data
Section: science
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: basic data files for the libswe package
 This package includes basic data files needed by libswe, the Swiss Ephemeris.
 The basic data consists of these files:
 /usr/share/libswe/users/ephe/sedeltat.txt.inactive
 /usr/share/libswe/users/ephe/sefstars.txt
 /usr/share/libswe/users/ephe/seleapsec.txt
 /usr/share/libswe/users/ephe/seorbel.txt
 /usr/share/libswe/users/ephe/fixstars.cat
 The Swiss Ephemeris library can be used without installed data,
 if the user provides that data in her own private directory
 and points to it with SE_EPHE_PATH.
