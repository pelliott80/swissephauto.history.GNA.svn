libswe for Debian
-----------------


dpkg-source -x does work correctly. But this package is somewhat unusual.

a 3 tarball sources are used. because of this no debian/watch file is possible:
See this bug:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=531321

In the below assume the current source version for swissephauto
is 1.77.00.0001.

This describes these 3 tarballs where they come from and what they do.

(1)
http://prdownload.berlios.de/swissephauto/libswe-1.77.00.0001.tar.bz2
	becomes libswe_1.77.00.0001.orig.tar.bz2 in the source.

This was create by Paul Elliott the web pages for this file are:
http://swissephauto.blackpatchpanel.com/
https://developer.berlios.de/projects/swissephauto/

This files contains the autotools control files and some manpages.

(2)
ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph/swe_unix_src_1.77.00.tar.gz
	becomes libswe_1.77.00.0001.orig-astrodienst.tar.gz in the source

This is the "real" upstream source it contains all the .c and .h
files.  It is GPLed, but it contains a number of problems. It was not
really written with GNU/Linux in mind, its layout is non standard. It
contains prebuild binaries which are not used or distributed by this
package. In every case, the package ignores these. In the building of
this package, for every prebuilt binary in the tarball, a similar file
will be rebuilt from source.  The source for certain documentation
files is missing.  Web page for this is:
http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephinfo_e.htm?lang=e

(3)
http://prdownload.berlios.de/swissephauto/libswe-1.77.00.astrodocsrc.tar.bz2
	becomes libswe_1.77.00.0001.orig-astrodocsrc.tar.bz2  in the source.

This provides the missing documentation source and it contains a statment
from the upstream authors that the license applies to these files as well.
Thus the source for all documentation is there for all files. All documentation
is rebuilt from source in this package.
This was resourced by Paul Elliott. Hopefully, this file will not be needed
in the next release.




With all the the problems with the astrodienst tarball, it may be asked,
"Why do you not resource the astrodiest tarball into the tarball
containing your auto*tools tarball creating one unified source
without the confusion and complications of a multi source tarball?
Everything could be done in a GNU/Linux standard way, the faux pas
associated with the astrodienst tarball could be eliminated."

The answer to this is that I know my limitations. Astrological
programming is an arcane art that requires many years of study. While
I am a C language programer and a packager, I simply am not an
astrological programmer.

Not having any .c or .h files in my release is my institutional way of
refusing responsibility for the content of these files. All bugs
associated with the content of these files will be refered to the true
upstream, i.e. the folks at Astrodienst. The only reason they are in
my SVN repository is that the GPL requires that I publish these files
if I use them.
