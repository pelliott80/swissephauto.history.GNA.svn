# 3 tarball sources are used. because of this no debian/watch file is possible:
# See this bug:
# http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=531321
#
# if a watch file were possible first part would look like this:
#version=3

#all 3 of the below commented out entries work in the sense
#that they are capabable of downloading the 3 files
#the problems is the last 2 entries do not store the file
#with the correct local file name. opts=filenamemangle can not be made to
#work. We really do wait for the fix of the bug mentioned above.
