swe_unix_src_X.XX.XX.tar.gz are copyright Dieter Koch and Alois
Treindl and are licensed under the GPL version 2 or later as described
by the file src/LICENSE. References to the Swiss Ephemeris
Professional License, I ignore as I am a free software packager. I
rely on the GPL. All the other files, (mostly having to do with
autotools building or packaging), Are Copyright Paul Elliott 2011 and
are licensed under the GPL version 2 or later which is included below.

The files swephprg.doc swisseph.doc are also copyright Dieter Koch and
Alois an licensed under the GPL version 2 or later as described by the
file src/LICENSE as confirmed by confirm-copywrite.email.

If I ever find it necessary to edit one of the original Swiss
Ephemeris distribution files, (has not happened yet as of Fri Apr 8
22:03:26 CDT 2011), then that file will be copyright Dieter Koch and
Alois Treindl and Paul Elliott and it will be licensed under the GPL
version 2 or later.

Thus every file in this distribution is copyrighted by somebody. And
every file is licensed under the GPL version 2 or later.
