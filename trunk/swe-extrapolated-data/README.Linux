The swe-extrapolated-data package contains only data files for the periods:
11 Aug 13000 BC to 5402 BC
and
5400 AD to  7 Jan 16800 AD
such data is not usually needed by people not doing extraordinary
research.



In addition there are numberless asteroid files at the
astrodienst site. No one would want all of these. If you want
one of these you may either install it yourself or ask
Paul Elliott <pelliott@blackpatchpanel.com> to package a specific
file.
