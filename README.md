This repository represents the state of development that existed
when the SwissephAuto project was on Gna! The Gna! used subversion
for its source control system. I intend no further development until
I can reorganize this repository to be more git friendly and
understandable. I have put it up now for historical interest.
Development is better delayed till then.
